      <h1 class="display-3">Some tips to start working out!</h1>
      <p class="lead">A lot of us live very busy lives. We are either at work five days a week, struggle to juggle classes in college or highschool, or just can't find time to ever take a breath. We tend to make excuses everytime we tell ourselves that we need to go to the gym, or spend more time out of the day to cook a meal instead of going through the drive through at McDonalds. The first step in taking the time to create a healthier you is to stop making those excuses! We need to remind ourselves truly how important it is to take care of ourselves both mentally and physically. Life may be hectic, but there is always time in the day to take care of yourself. Start by giving your body the energy it needs. It is all about small changes. Apply the changes you want to make one at a time, until you get used to them. For instance, take eating healthier for instance. Eat something healthy when you're feeling a snack, drink water instead of soda, make a list before you go to the grocery store of the only things you want to buy, or maybe even make a pizza instead of ordering out. These changes may seem little, but give yourself 3-4 weeks and your body will love you for it. Now lets talk about working out. Invest in good workout shoes, and an overall nice workout outfit. Nobody feels better when working out whem they look good right? Next, take time to schedule your workouts when it is most convient for you. Making a plan makes it easier for you to hold yourself accountable and less of a chance you will let yourself skip. This may only be two steps, but they are the first two steps to creating a healthier you. Check out the following link for some more ways to start working on a healthier lifesytle.</p>
