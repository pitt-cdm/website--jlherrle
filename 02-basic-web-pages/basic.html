  <body> hello
    <p> first we need to learn some basic HTML. </p>
    <h2>headings</h2>
    <p>headings define the outline of your site. there are six levels of headings. </p>
  </body>
  <h2>lists</h2>
  <p> this is how you make an unordered list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>add each item in its own "lil" element</li>
    <li>they don't need to be in any particular order</li>
  </ul>
  <p> this is what an ordered lisrt looks like:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
    <li>but, the list item elements are the same</li>
    <li>also not how the numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>you should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>incline elements</h2>
  <p><em>sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
  <p>other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
  <p><em><strong>and sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
  <h2>empty elements</h2>
  <p>thanks for reading!interneting should be getting easier now</p>
